# Red Dead Redemption 2 (PC) Fix for Low Audio Volume

This is a temporary fix for the common bug in RDR2 where the audio volume is set to a very low number every time the game starts.

It will automatically reset the volume level every few seconds for RDR2.exe. Or download AutoHotKey, clone this repo, and run the RDR2AudioFix.ahk script manually.

Right Click on RDR2AudioFix.ahk and compile to create your own .exe

Or double click RDR2AudioFix.ahk to run directly.

## Installation / Running at Startup
* Open the run dialog (Win + R)
* Type shell:startup
* (or browse to %appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup)
* Copy the .exe into that folder
* Run the .exe
* (Windows SmartScreen may pop up, just click more info and then Run Anyways)
