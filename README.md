# Red Dead Redemption 2 (PC) Fix for Low Audio Volume

This is a temporary fix for the common bug in RDR2 where the audio volume is set to a very low number every time the game starts.

Just run the .exe file and it will automatically reset the volume level every few seconds for RDR2.exe. Or download AutoHotKey and run the script manually.

## Installation / Running at Startup
* Download the [RDR2AudioFix.exe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andyjsmith/RDR2AudioFix/master/RDR2AudioFix.exe)
* Open the run dialog (Win + R)
* Type shell:startup
* (or browse to %appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup)
* Copy the .exe into that folder
* Run the .exe
